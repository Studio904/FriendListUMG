## Issue found in the way
- The UList View RemoveItem() does not work properly, I have to use the clearList and with the DataTable reRender the list.
- The binding of the delegate in the service that uses the model is unbound randomly, where the update is sudden.
- The Use of ObjectListEntry Class to add items and remove them from the UListView.
